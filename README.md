# developer-hub

This repository serves as a collection of independent code examples and small applications.
It is designed to be a place where different projects can be hosted without being part of a single, unified codebase.

## How to use

The repository itself does not contain a single application to run at the root level.
Instead, the functionality resides in the various subdirectories.

- **Browse the Directories**: Each directory (e.g., capture, get-started, etc.) contains a complete, isolated project.

- **Navigate to a Project**: Change your directory to the one you are interested in.
- Dependencies and configurations are kept separate for each project.

- **Find the Local Instructions**: Every project directory contains its own README.md file.
- This file holds all the necessary, project-specific instructions for setup, running, testing, and understanding the code.

- **Run the App**: Follow the steps in that specific project's README.md to run the example locally.

**Examples**:

- To capture data into your IKG (Aura instance) in the IndyKite platform using the Capture REST API, run: `cd capture`
- To get started with the IK platform, run: `cd get-started`
